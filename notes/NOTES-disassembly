For disassembly:

avr-objdump -s foo.hex > foo.hexdump
avr-objdump -D foo.hex > foo.asm  (forces interpretation as code)

avr-objdump -d foo.elf > foo.asm  (clean and symbol-annotated)


To get call patterns:

grep -f patterns.txt foo.asm

patterns.txt has one pattern per line; using "0000" and "call" worked 
for getting entrypoints (listed by address) and calls.
